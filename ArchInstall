Install Plain Vanilla Arch
=========================
1. These install instructions assume that you already have your partition designated and already have another Linux distro 
that boots from that drive. In this case you do not need to install grub to your new Arch install. You will just need to boot 
into your prime distro and run "os-prober" and "update-grub". 

Download Arch - Copy to USB using in terminal: (rename downloaded iso to "arch")

sudo dd bs=4M if=arch.iso of=/dev/sxx  (xx=your device name)

Once done copying, reboot ( go into bios and select to boot from USB)

Once booted you will already be logged in as root.

In terminal run the following commands in order:

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sxx   (change xx to your install device)

mount /dev/sxx /mnt  (this mounts the install partition)

pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel  (installs the base arch system)

genfstab -U /mnt > /mnt/etc/fstab  (generates your fstab file)

arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash  (enables you to modify the files in config of your system)

nano /etc/locale.gen (opens locale.gen file)
  * once the file is open, uncomment your country entries. Then ctrl-o then enter to save. Then control-x to exit.

locale-gen (generates your locale config file.

echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 >/etc/locale.conf  (writes your locale.conf file and saves)

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/EST5EDT /etc/localtime  (this is my timezone. Substitute your info after zoneinfo)

hwclock --systohc --utc

mkinitcpio -p linux

echo "pick your hostname" > /etc/hostname

ip link (lists your network devices)

systemctl enable dhcpcd@"your eth device name".service

pacman -S dialog iw networkmanager network-manager-applet gnome-keyring

passwd (you will now set the root password)
 * enter password twice

exit

umount -R /mnt

reboot (when you boot into your main distro, run os-prober and update-grub)

Note: sign in as root with your new password

commands:

useradd -m -g users -s /bin/bash (your new user name)

passwd (your new user name)
   * enter password twice

pacman -S sudo

EDITOR=nano visudo
  *sudoers file will open.scroll down below "user privelege specification". 
   Under the root line add another line
   to read same as the root line but with your new user name. Example: len  ALL=(ALL) ALL
   Cotrol-o to save, then enter, then control-x to exit.
   *logout as root, then login as your new user.

sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf (opens your pacman config file)
  * uncomment multilib both lines (not testing) then 2 lines below add the following:
    archlinuxfr (enclose this in brackets-Youtube would not let me post brackets)
    SigLevel = Never
    Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch
   * then control-o to save, then enter, then control-x to exit back to command line.

sudo pacman -S multilib-devel fakeroot git jshon wget make pkg-config autoconf automake patch

sudo pacman -S alsa-utils

alsamixer 
    * (entering the letter M mutes and unmutes the channels. Mute the channels you don't need and set the 
       levels of the ones you need. Then "escape" to exit

speaker-test -c 2 (assuming you have 2 speakers.)

sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit xorg-server-utils mesa

sudo pacman -S nvidia lib32-nvidia-utils (assuming you have nvidia gaphics)

reboot

sudo nvidia-xconfig

wifi-menu (should find your wifi network, then connect to your network)

sudo pacman -S xorg-twm xorg-xclock xterm

startx (you should see 3 open windows. (hover your mouse over each one at a time and type exit to close all 3)

sudo pacman -S lxdm lxde xfce4 xfce4-goodies

sudo systemctl enable lxdm.service

sudo systemctl start lxdm.service

sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager

sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service
   *reboot into LXDM login screen. Once at login screen select your preferred desktop 
    from the dropdown list on the lowerleft.

sudo pacman -S gvfs (to show all mounted devices)

sudo pacman -S file-roller unrar p7zip pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa
 
sudo pacman -S package-query

sudo pacman -S yaourt

sudo pacman -S volti (puts a volume control in your systray) make sure you set it to autostart.

yaourt -S flashplugin hal-flash

Enjoy Arch Linux!
